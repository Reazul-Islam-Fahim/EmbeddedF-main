In our country, people while passing through an official wok, need to recourse to other officers. They cannot know whether the officer is present in his/her room, unless they visit.If the officers are absent in their room, then people who want to have the services and their coming is in vain. Our motive is to solve this problem by building some device which can detect the presence of the officers and update the presence status for the visitors in the application.
